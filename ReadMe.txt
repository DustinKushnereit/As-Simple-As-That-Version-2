This game was a month long project. Version one of "As Simple As That" was made in two weeks during my Sophomore year of college.

Concept Statement:

"This game is classified as an arcade style educational game. We want our players to be able to continuously play the game and get enjoyment out of it while still learning about strong moral values and learning how to sympathizing with other cultures. The game's intention is to teach the player about Ramadan, but more specifically the type of values that the Holy month intends to inspire. The game will feature decision making skills that are similar to those that have to be made by people who fast during the moth - we want to teach our players to give more than they take and the ability to have will power over temptation. The game shouldn't punish players for giving into temptation every once in a while because nit's okay for them to reward themselves as long as they don't get greedy."

The movement is controlled with the arrow keys.
